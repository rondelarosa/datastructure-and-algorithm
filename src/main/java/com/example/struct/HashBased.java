 * Hash-based structures are great when working with collections, sets, and data formatted as key-value fairs
 * HashSet - is an unordered collection of unique items.
 * HashMap - is useful for key-value pairs.
 * The HashMap type is often recommended over the HashTable because it provides more flexibility and better performance.
 * The HashMap allows null values and duplicate values, and not synchronize so it tends to have better performance.
